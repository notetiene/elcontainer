> ðŸ˜¶ Avoid side-effects when executing Emacs Lisp

**_emacs-lisp-container_** is a simple attempt to avoid side-effects
when executing an Emacs Lisp body.  i.e. it wonâ€™t modify the
environment.

While there are probably better alternatives for executing an Emacs
subprocess (like the
excellent [emacs-sync](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async)
library), the solutions I found were not able to handle an already
existing Emacs Environment.  It simply creates a brand new emacs
process and cannot take into account the current run-time environment.
